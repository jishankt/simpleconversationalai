"""
Evaluation Suite & Live Runner for Verified Citizen Photo Printers.

Verified Product Set:
  1. Citizen CX-02 (citizen-cx-02)
  2. Citizen CX-02W (citizen-cx-02w)
  3. Citizen CY-02 (citizen-cy-02)
  4. Citizen CZ-01 (citizen-cz-01)

Required Corrections Enforced:
  - CX-02S catalogue tests replaced with CX-02W tests.
  - CX-02S retained only as a non-catalogue / hallucination test.
  - CY-02 resolution contradiction resolved: dual-mode 300 dpi High Speed (300x300 dpi) & 600 dpi High Quality (300x600 dpi).
  - Unsupported consumable claims removed: core diameter, IC chips, mechanical jamming, printhead mismatch.
  - No commercial, pricing, discount, quotation, proposal, lead capture, sales rep, or handover mentions.
  - "Listed in catalogue" distinguished from "currently in stock".
  - Stores for every query:
      raw_user_query, full_chatbot_answer, resolved_product_id, retrieved_source,
      supporting_evidence, unsupported_claims, validator_result, pass_fail.
  - Strict assertion traceability to approved catalogue fields.
