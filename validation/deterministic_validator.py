"""
Deterministic Response Validator for Kepler Tech Conversational AI.

Enforces 8 strict zero-hallucination checks on every generated response:
1. product_id matches source product_id (and URL product_id and evidence product_id)
2. product name matches URL
3. every numeric value exists in retrieved evidence for the ACTIVE product only
4. consumable SKU is linked to the selected printer
5. no rejected SKU exists in the catalogue
6. no global absence claims ("does not exist" -> "not found in our approved catalogue")
7. no absolute guarantees ("100% guaranteed" -> forbidden)
8. no unsupported speculative claims

Automatically fails an answer when any product name, SKU, speed, weight,
size, capacity or compatibility claim lacks exact evidence for the active product.
Never accepts a value merely because another catalogue product has it.
